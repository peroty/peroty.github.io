# Prose.io is a simple front end for blogging.

I love the idea if a static blog. I do not like the idea of having to interact with it through git. When I saw this article today, I jad to try it out.

[Choosing a headless CMS for my simple static blog – This day’s portion](https://www.thisdaysportion.com/posts/choosing-a-headless-cms-for-your-simple-static-blog/)

> As headless CMSs become more sophisticated they require more configuration; too much, perhaps, for a simple blog. So it’s maybe unsurprising that the best post-Forestry solution I’ve found is Prose, which is, as far as I’m aware, the oldest headless CMS of all, and requires no configuration beyond giving it access to your Github account.
