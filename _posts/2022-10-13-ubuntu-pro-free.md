# Ubuntu Pro free for 5 users - LivePatch your Linux

Today I Learned Ubuntu made their Ubuntu Pro service available for free up to 5 users from [The Homelab Show: Episode 75](https://thehomelab.show/2022/10/13/the-homelab-show-ep-75-homelab-privacy-security-and-qa/). I've linked it with timestamp on Youtube but it's just past 35 mins.

I used it for the [Kernel Livepatch](https://ubuntu.com/security/livepatch) and it's Magical. I am not using it professionally. I run Ubuntu on a desktop at home and on a couple of servers in virtual containers. I like that I can keep my desktop up to date and (once I decide which ones) do the same with some of my virtual servers.
