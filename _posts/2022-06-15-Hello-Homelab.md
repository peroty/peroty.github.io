## Getting setup

[Techno Tim, One of my favorite Youtube homelabbers produced a video on Jekyll and getting it setup and running on Github pages.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q) I've long gone back and forth on Hugo vs. Jekyll. I have a WordPress blog (a few of them.) But it's going in a different direction than I am.

I have to many text files. Markdown flows all over my hard drive. And I wanted some easier way to take those files and present them not only to myself to remember what I had done, but to save those notes in a public-ish way.

Instead of losing them forever on my hard drive, they would be public and hosted so others might benefit from them, or Future Carl could find them.
