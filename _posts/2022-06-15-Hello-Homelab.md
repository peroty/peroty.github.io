## Getting setup

[Techno Tim, One of my favorite Youtube homelabbers produced a video on Jekyll and getting it setup and running on Github pages.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q) I've long gone back and forth on Hugo vs. Jekyll. I have a WordPress blog (a few of them.) But it's going in a different direction than I am.

I have to many text files. Markdown flows all over my hard drive. And I wanted some easier way to take those files and present them not only to myself to remember what I had done, but to save those notes in a public-ish way.

Instead of losing them forever on my hard drive, they would be public and hosted so others might benefit from them, or Future Carl could find them.

So... even though Tim doesn't show it in the video, you need to add a date to your `post` titles, otherwise they won't show up and you'll be scratching your head.

He does note this on his documentation site.
