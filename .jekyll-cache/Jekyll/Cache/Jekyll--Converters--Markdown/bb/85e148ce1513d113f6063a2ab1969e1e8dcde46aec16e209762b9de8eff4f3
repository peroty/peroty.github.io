<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q">Techno Tim, One of my favorite Youtube homelabbers produced a video on Jekyll and getting it setup and running on Github pages.</a> Iâ€™ve long gone back and forth on Hugo vs. Jekyll. I have a WordPress blog (a few of them.) But itâ€™s going in a different direction than I am.</p>

<p>I have to many text files. Markdown flows all over my hard drive. And I wanted some easier way to take those files and present them not only to myself to remember what I had done, but to save those notes in a public-ish way.</p>

<p>Instead of losing them forever on my hard drive, they would be public and hosted so others might benefit from them, or Future Carl could find them.</p>

<p>Soâ€¦ even though Tim doesnâ€™t show it in the video, you need to add a date to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post</code> titles, otherwise they wonâ€™t show up and youâ€™ll be scratching your head.</p>

<p>He does note this on his documentation site.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://docs.technotim.live/posts/jekyll-docs-site/">Meet Jekyll - The Static Site Generator | Techno Tim Documentation</a><br />
Create a file in _posts with the format  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

  <p>For example:</p>

  <p>2022-05-23-homelab-docs.md<br />
2022-05-34-hardware-specs.md</p>
